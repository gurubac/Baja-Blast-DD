SEARCHBAR
- rounded edges (priority: low)

LINKS
- instead of faq add a suggestions/comments/feedback contact form page

PAGES
- make a contact form page (user add location request, any feedback/suggestions)

GITHUB README 
- update it with more info

TIMESTAMPS 
- once they are in the database, they are stuck to the timezone they were created in which would lead to people in different time zones seeing the previously created TIMESTAMPS

NAVBAR
- Look nicer on mobile/fitting

MAP PANEL
- fix scaling and sizing
- header overlaps searchbar at small resolutios, and this probably ties in with the style tag on line 22 where height is 100 percent for the whole body. 

ADS
- perhaps
