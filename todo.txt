GITHUB README 
- update it with more info

Comments/Voting system type thing
- work on front end style (priority : low)

TIMESTAMPS 
- once they are in the database, they are stuck to the timezone they were created in which would lead to people in different time zones seeing the previously created TIMESTAMPS
- this issue is a bit trivial to be honest, because people in different timezones have no need to see the status of the machine in a different time zone, but it would be nice to fix
- (priority : super low)

ROUTES 
- for loop through the database and add routes for all locations
